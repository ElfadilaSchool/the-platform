# Salary Management System - Improvements Summary
**Quick Presentation for Management**

---

## 🎯 Problem We Solved

**Before:** Salary and Attendance showed different data for the same employee

**Example:**
- **Attendance Page:** 7 worked days, 10 absent days ✅
- **Salary Details:** 12 worked days, 0 absent days ❌

This caused confusion and trust issues.

## ✅ Solution

**Unified Data Source:** Both modules now use the **exact same calculation**

```
Attendance Page  →  Same Calculation  →  Salary Management
     ✅                                  ✅
```

**Result:** 100% data consistency
